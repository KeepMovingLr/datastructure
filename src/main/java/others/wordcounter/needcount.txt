It will make your skin look dewy and fresh, your bones and nails strong, and your joints pain-free. These are the claims made by the countless manufacturers of collagen supplements that come in the form of powders, pills and creams. For that reason, it’s no surprise that collagen has become a widely sought-after ingredient in the wellness and beauty communities. But collagen’s efficacy is still pretty up in the air. Frustrated? Here’s what we know.
What is collagen?
Collagen is “the main structural protein that forms the connective tissue throughout our body, from skin to bones, muscles, tendons and ligaments, ” said Dr. Shari Marchbein, a board-certified dermatologist based in New York.
But as we age, our bodies naturally start reducing collagen production. Board-certified dermatologist Dr. Whitney Bowe described our body’s collagen as “ropes of protein in the skin.” When we’re young, the rope remains tight, but as we age, the ends begin to fray.
Does collagen work?
Some studies show that taking collagen supplements for several months can improve skin elasticity as well as signs of aging. Others have shown that consuming collagen can increase density in bones weakened with age. But many of these studies are small and funded by companies that make the product, increasing the opportunity for bias in the results.
So, should you try collagen?
Maybe! But get ready for a very committed relationship. If collagen does work, and you’re looking for long-lasting effects, you’ll have to take supplements for the rest of your life. Why? The answer is collagenase. Our bodies are constantly producing this enzyme and it eats away at our natural collagen. So if collagen supplements improve your skin, bones and joints, you’ll need to keep taking them.
